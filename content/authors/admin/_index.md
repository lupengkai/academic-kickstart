I am a third-year master student of Department of Mathematical Sciences, Zhejiang University, majoring in Operations Research & Cybernetics. I am very fortunate to be advised by Professor [Shuping Chen](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E9%99%88%E5%8F%94%E5%B9%B3/6877?fr=aladdin). Previously, I studied pure mathematics at Sichuan University.


During the graduate stage, I have been doing research on unlicensed taxis detection algorithm based on traffic surveillance data, the main work are as follows:

+ Proposing two novel features, “path irregularity” and “time irregularity”, for classifying vehicles.
+ Proposing a trajectory segment algorithm which divides monitoring records of a vehicle into trips.
+ Achieving better accuracy and using less execution time compared with previous work based on real-world data


Besides those mentioned above, I also do some projects, like train tickets pre-allocation. Broadly, I am also interested in social network analysis, statistical algorithms and so on. 


Last but not least, I am a girl of versatile tastes, like running marathons, calligraphy, playing table tennis and travel.
