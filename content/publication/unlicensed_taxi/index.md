abstract: "Unlicensed taxi services severely disrupt traffic management and threaten passengersâ€™ safety. Traditional approaches to detect unlicensed taxis rely highly on manual work like collecting on-site evidence. However, these approaches are ineffective and inefficient. As to address this hardship, we propose an unlicensed taxi detection algorithm using pass-records data collected from surveillance cameras. First, based on spatio-temporal analysis, we propose path irregularity and time irregularity to distinguish commercial vehicles from non-commercial vehicles. Then, we evaluate the algorithm based on the actual vehicle pass-records data of Guiyang. The results show that our algorithm outperforms baselines in terms of accuracy and running time."
