Even though I am not good at running and I could not finish even 800 meters in the first training, I stick out the race finally. Throughout the course of 42.195 kilometers, I push my body to its limits, maintain a comfortable pace, and finish the race about 5h24min. Running is a love/hate sport because it requires a good amount of discipline and will power. The hard work and dedication of running, however, reap the rewards of physical fitness, personal accomplishment and self-mastery."
